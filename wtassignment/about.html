			<h1>Ardorki Kamar</h1>
			<p>Hello!!My Name is Ardorki Kamar,I'm currently pursuing my Btech(Information Technolohy) in North Eastern Hill University,Shillong.<br>This website is being made as part of the given assignment and I believe it will also help someone to explore our small state Meghalaya particularly.The main aim of me creating this webpage is to bring the attention of the user towards our state thereby make them aware of the different tourist spot,facilities available in our area.Afterall,It's better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.
				<br>“The traveller sees what he sees. The tourist sees what he has come to see.”
